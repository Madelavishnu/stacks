>>this file is about the  data cleaning and preprocessing
>>here at first,we have to collect some data for prediction or classification or visulisation from free open resoures
>>next we have to load the data according to their format
>>by analysis the given dataset .there are some missing value are there. if there is lot missing value we have to drop that column that's why i drop "cabin"(column")
>>after that describe the dataset shows min,max,mean,meadian ,mode etc...
>>after that we fill NaN value using data handling methods
>>then we have to encode some columns which is easy to understand
>>i choose standarize processing to balance the data
>>now I'm decided to visualize the data using boxplot
